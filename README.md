# rpb
A simple progress bar for Rust projects. I created that because there was a long processes in some project and I didn't know what was the progression.

## Installation
Add from command line.
```
cargo add rpb@0.1.1
```
Or add this to your Cargo.toml file.
```
[dependencies]
rpb = "0.1.1"

# Or add from github main branch.
rpb = { git = "https://github.com/disco07/rpb.git", branch = "main" }

```

## Usage
### Basic usage
```rust
fn main() {
    use rpb::bar::Bar;
    use std::thread::sleep;
    use std::time;
    
    let mut bar = Bar::new(100);

    for _i in 0..100 {
        bar.add(1);
        sleep(time::Duration::from_millis(100))
    }
}
```
